# predictive-modelling-boston
_Predictive modelling using GLM, RF and GBM. A toy example on the Boston Housing dataset._

This project is a quick predictive modelling exercise. Generalized Linear Models, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines are used to produce out-of-sample predictions for the median value of owner-occupied homes in the Boston Housing dataset.

The repo contains the following items:
- This readme file (README.md)
- An analysis report in pdf format (report.pdf)
- A markdown file to reproduce the analysis (report.Rmd)
- Plain R code to reproduce the analysis
